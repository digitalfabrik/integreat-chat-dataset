## Answer: The district of Augsburg provides a contraceptive fund that covers the costs of certain contraceptives for residents who are at least 23 years old and receive social benefits such as Citizen's income (SGB II), social assistance (SGB XII), housing benefit, child supplement, or benefits under the Asylum Seekers' Benefits Act (AsylbLG). The covered costs include the pill, Copper IUD, hormone coil, hormone implant, three-month injection, vaginal ring, contraceptive patch, and sterilization for women and men. The applicant must submit an application to the pregnancy counseling service at the Augsburg District Office, provide a notification of their social benefit, identity card and confirmation of registration, and a prescription or cost proposal from a doctor, as well as a consultation with the pregnancy counseling service and an invoice from the pharmacy or doctor.
