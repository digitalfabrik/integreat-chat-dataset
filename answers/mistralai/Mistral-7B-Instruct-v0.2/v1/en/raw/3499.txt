## Answer: To attend an integration course, you need a permit (authorization certificate) from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF). You can then register for the course at a language school. Some people are required to attend the course by the Office for Foreigners and Integration. The integration course lasts several months and consists of a language course and an orientation course on life in Germany. The aim is to achieve language level B1 on completion of the course. The certificate received upon completion is important for various reasons such as looking for work or applying for a permanent residence permit. There are also special integration courses for certain groups of people. Participants pay fees based on their BAMF authorization status. ## Numbers: 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41. ##
