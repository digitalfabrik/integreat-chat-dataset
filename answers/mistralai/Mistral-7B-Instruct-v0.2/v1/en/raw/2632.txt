## Answer: After 6 months in Germany, you must register your child at a school. Registration for elementary schools in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg takes place between beginning of March to end of April, with the deadline being end of June (your child must be 6 years old by this date). You will need your identity card, birth certificate or proof of arrival, registration certificate, and all documents relating to your child. Please take your child to the school to register.
