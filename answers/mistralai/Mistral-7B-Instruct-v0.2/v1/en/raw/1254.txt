## Answer: The duration of elementary school is 4 years. ## Numbers: 1, 46, 7, 8, 11 (The context mentions that after elementary school, children go on to secondary school, and there are 15 secondary schools in the district, implying that the number of years in elementary school must be less than the number of years in secondary school. The context also mentions that children must attend a particular primary school based on their area, which is the Sprengelprinzip, and that if a parent wants to change schools, they must submit a guest school application. These details, along with the statement that elementary school lasts for 4 years, allow us to determine that elementary school is the first stage of education and lasts for 4 years.)
