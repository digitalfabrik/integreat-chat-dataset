## Answer: Newly immigrated children and adolescents can attend Gymnasium without completing primary school, but there is a grade requirement of up to 3.33. ## Numbers: 4, 8

## Note: The age requirement for starting Gymnasium education is not explicitly stated in the context. However, it is mentioned that newly immigrated children and adolescents who have not attended a German Grundschule from year 1 can attend Gymnasium, which implies that they can start Gymnasium at a relatively young age. However, there is a grade requirement for them to meet. Therefore, the answer above provides the closest information to the question. If a definitive age requirement is needed, further research or consultation with educational authorities would be necessary.
