## Answer: To apply for social housing in Germany, you need to make an application for registration at the Amt f√ºr Wohnen und Migration. You can submit the application online via SOWON or on paper. Required documents include proof of income, identity card or passport, rental contract or proof of current living situation, and other documents depending on individual circumstances. Once all requirements are checked, you will be registered for a subsidised apartment and can search for offers on SOWON.
