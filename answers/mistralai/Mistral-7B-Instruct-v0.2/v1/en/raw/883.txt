## Answer: None. ## Numbers: -1

The context provides the information that the Grundgesetz (basic law) is the main legal basis of life in Germany and that all persons shall have the right to free development of their personality, but it does not explicitly state that everyone living in Germany must follow the Grundgesetz. However, the context does imply this by stating that the Grundgesetz protects human dignity, guarantees personal freedoms, and promotes equality before the law, among other things. Therefore, it can be inferred that everyone living in Germany is expected to respect and abide by these principles.
