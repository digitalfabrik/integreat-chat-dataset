## Answer: You may be liable for costs even if you cannot read or understand a contract you signed. ## Numbers: 10, 12

Explanation: The context advises against signing anything that you cannot understand or read (number 10), and goes on to explain that signing a contract may result in costs for you (number 12). Therefore, if you sign a contract that you cannot read or understand, you may still be liable for the costs associated with it.
