## Answer: You may be liable for costs or prosecution if you sign a contract that you don't understand. ## Numbers: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

Explanation: The context states that contracts are binding and can only be terminated within the applicable notice period (8). If you are not sure whether you can pay the costs or have understood everything correctly, you should not conclude a contract (9). Signing something that you cannot understand or read may result in costs for you (10, 11, 12). Therefore, if you sign a contract that you don't understand, you may be liable for costs or prosecution.
