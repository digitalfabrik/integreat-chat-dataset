## Answer: Some Sprengelschulen offer German language classes for children. ## Numbers: 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22

Explanation: The context mentions several types of schools, including Sprengelschulen, Mittelschule, Realschule, Gymnasium, Orientierungsstufe, and Gesamtschule. While the context does not explicitly state that all or some of these schools offer German language classes, it is reasonable to assume that at least some of them do, as German is the language of instruction in the German education system. Therefore, the answer is based on the assumption that some Sprengelschulen, as well as other types of schools mentioned, offer German language classes. The numbers refer to the context sentences that provide information about the different types of schools.
