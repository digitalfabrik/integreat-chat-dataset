## Answer: To apply for public health insurance in Germany, you can take out health insurance with a health insurance company. You have the option of choosing between statutory or private health insurance. Most people have statutory health insurance, but eligibility for private health insurance depends on certain criteria such as income. Once you have chosen and signed up with a health insurance company, they will provide you with an insurance card. With this card, you can receive medical services throughout Germany and in many European countries.
