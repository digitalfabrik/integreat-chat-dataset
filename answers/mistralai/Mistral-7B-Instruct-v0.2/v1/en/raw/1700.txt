(Note: The context mentions "Vocational guidance supports you in your choice of study and career, during training and at the beginning of your working life" and "In a personal counselling interview you can clarify all important questions about your professional future." However, it does not explicitly state that the counselling is provided by the specific organizations listed in the context. Therefore, while it is a reasonable assumption that those organizations offer vocational guidance, the context does not provide enough information to definitively answer the question using only the context.)
