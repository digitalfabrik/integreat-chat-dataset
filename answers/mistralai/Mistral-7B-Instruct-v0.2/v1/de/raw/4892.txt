## Answer: Die öffentlichen Grundschulen bieten Deutschunterricht für Kinder an. ## Numbers: 0, 1, 4, 13

Explanation: The context mentions that children must attend a public school from the age of six and that they learn reading, writing, and arithmetic in primary school (Grundschule). It also states that after leaving primary school, children attend different types of secondary schools (Mittelschule, Realschule, Gymnasium, Orientierungsstufe, or Gesamtschule), but it does not explicitly mention that they receive German instruction in these schools. However, it is stated that all children attend primary school, which implies that German is taught there as it is a required subject in Germany. Therefore, the answer is that public primary schools offer German instruction for children. The sentence numbers refer to the context sentences that support this answer.
