## Answer: The notice period for employees depends on the duration of the employment relationship. For example, it is two months for a relationship of five years and two weeks for a probationary period of up to six months. The notice period for employers is normally four weeks to the end of a month. If an employee wants to appeal a termination notice from their employer, they have three weeks to do so.
