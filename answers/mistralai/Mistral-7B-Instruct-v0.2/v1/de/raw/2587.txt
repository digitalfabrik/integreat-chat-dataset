Explanation: The question asks for consultation places in Rems-Murr-Kreis. The context provides several options, including a general consultation place (Beratungsstelle), a crisis, clarification, and mediation service (KKV), a doctor's office (Hausarzt), and a health department (Gesundheitsamt). The context also mentions a psychiatrist and psychotherapist (Facharzt f√ºr Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie), but it does not specify a location for this service. Therefore, the answer includes the options that directly answer the question, and the numbers correspond to the sentences that provide this information. The context also mentions other options, such as a specialist for traumatization (Traumatisierung) and depression (Depression), but these are not consultation places in the strict sense and are not directly related to the question. Therefore, they are not included in the answer or the numbers.
