## Answer: 4, 6, 11-12. ## Numbers: 1, 4-7, 9, 11-12.

Explanation: The question asks for information on how to find free German courses. The context provides information on three language consultation services, which can help find suitable courses. Therefore, the answer includes the numbers of the sentences that mention free courses or language courses. In this case, it is the Volkshochschule Augsburg mentioned in sentences 11 and 12, which offers language courses, but the context does not specify if they are free or not. However, since the question asks for free courses, it is assumed that the consultation services provided by the context can help find free courses as well. Therefore, the numbers of the sentences that mention any language courses or consultation services are included in the answer.
