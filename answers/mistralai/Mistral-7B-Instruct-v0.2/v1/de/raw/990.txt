## Answer: 2 ## Numbers: 0, 2

The context states that individuals who possess a valid Schengen Visum can reside in the entire Schengen Area for a period of 180 days or 90 days. Therefore, a valid Schengen Visum is the correct answer for staying in the entire Schengen Area.

The context also mentions that individuals must leave the Schengen Area during the validity period of their visa. However, this is not a requirement for entering the Schengen Area but rather a condition for maintaining the validity of the visa. Therefore, it is not the direct answer to the question.

Therefore, the answer is:

## Answer: 2 ## Numbers: 0, 2

And the incorrect answers are:

## Answer: None. ## Numbers: -1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16

These options are not the answer to the question as they do not describe a valid Schengen Visum that allows for travel in the entire Schengen Area.
