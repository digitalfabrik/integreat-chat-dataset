## Answer: You can cast your vote freely among the candidates on the entire ballot paper by marking all the persons you want to vote for, regardless of which list they are on. This is called Stimmensplitting. Additionally, you can give extra votes (up to three) to certain candidates. This is called Kumulierung. Alternatively, you can vote for a complete list by putting a cross next to the identifying name at the beginning of the list. Your votes will then be distributed to the candidates on that list in order, until all 40 votes are used up. You can also make changes to the list you have chosen, such as striking out names or giving extra votes to certain candidates. ## Numbers: 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.
## Answer: None. ## Numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16. (These sentences do not provide information on how to cast a vote in Germany.)
