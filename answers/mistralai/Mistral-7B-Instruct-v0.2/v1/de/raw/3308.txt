## Explanation: The question asks for the documents required for the residence permit application. The context mentions the documents for the residence permit application, but it does not explicitly state that they are for the residence permit and not for another type of permit. Therefore, the context does not provide a clear answer for the question. However, it mentions several documents that are typically required for a residence permit application, such as a passport, birth certificate, and proof of residence. These documents are mentioned in context numbers 15, 16, 17, and 18. Since the question asks specifically for the documents required for the residence permit application, and the context does not make it clear that these documents are for the residence permit, the answer is "None" with the numbers "-1" to indicate that there is no answer in the context for the given question. However, if we assume that the context refers to the residence permit application throughout, then the answer would be the documents mentioned in the context.
