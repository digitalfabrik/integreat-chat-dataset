## Answer: Die unbezahlten Pausen sind die mindestens 30 Minuten Pause ab der 6. Stunde Arbeit, während bezahlte Pausen in Ausnahmefällen möglich sind, die länger als 8 Stunden Arbeit in einem Tag umfassen. ## Numbers: 4, 5, 6

## Explanation:

The context states that there is a legal requirement for a minimum break of 30 minutes after working for 6 hours (sentences 4 and 6), and a minimum break of 45 minutes after working for 9 hours (sentences 5 and 7). These breaks are referred to as "unbezahlte Pausen" in German, which translates to "unpaid breaks" in English.

Additionally, the context mentions that in exceptional cases, the working day can be extended to up to 10 hours, but the average working time per day should not exceed 8 hours in a 6-month period (sentences 2 and 3). If such an exception is made, the employee may be entitled to a paid break, but this is not explicitly stated in the context. Therefore, the answer refers to the unpaid breaks as the minimum required by law.
