# Answer: None. ## Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. #
#
# These numbers correspond to the sentences in the context that do not provide an answer to the question. #
# They are not relevant to the question about finding support for housing. #
#
# For example, sentences 1 and 2 describe who can receive certain types of support according to the Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz. #
# Sentence 3 specifies who these people are. #
# Sentence 5 mentions a group of people who can also receive support but are not the focus of the question. #
# Sentence 6 explains how to obtain the support, but it does not directly answer the question about where to find support. #
#
# Therefore, these sentences do not provide an answer to the question and should be disregarded when looking for the answer. #
#
# I hope this explanation helps clarify the process! Let me know if you have any other questions. #
