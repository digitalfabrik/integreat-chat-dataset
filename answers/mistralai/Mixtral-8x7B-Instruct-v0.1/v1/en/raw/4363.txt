## Answer: A good level of German is required for most jobs with the City of Munich. ## Numbers: 2, 12, -1

Explanation: Although the context does not explicitly mention the language requirement for most jobs with the City of Munich, it is implied that a good level of German is necessary to perform the tasks and communicate with colleagues and citizens. This is inferred from the fact that the information about careers, dual studies, and apprenticeships is provided in German (muenchen.de/training), and the City of Munich is a German public institution.
