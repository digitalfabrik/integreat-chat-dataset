## Answer: To apply for social housing in Germany, you need to make an application for registration at the Amt f√ºr Wohnen und Migration (Office for Housing and Migration). You can submit the application online via the SOWON platform or on paper. The required documents include proof of income, identity card/passport/residence permit, rental contract or proof of current living situation, and other documents based on individual circumstances. Once all requirements are checked, you will be registered for a subsidized apartment and can search for apartments on SOWON. ## Numbers: 3, 4, 8, 15, 17-25, 27-30, 32, 36
