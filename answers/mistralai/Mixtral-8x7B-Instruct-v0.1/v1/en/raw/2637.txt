## Answer: If you are a refugee living in private accommodation or in municipal accommodation, you have access to integration management. The integration managers can support you in many areas, for example when applying for social benefits, residence permits, with support in everyday life (for example, explaining letters), in personal and family matters, for contacts with authorities, and for other questions. In order to promote your integration in Germany, an individual plan (integration plan) can be drawn up. If you need help or support, give us a call and make an appointment. ## Numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 ##
