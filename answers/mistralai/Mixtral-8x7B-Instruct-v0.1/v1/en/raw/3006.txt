## Answer: To register for an integration course in the Rems-Murr district, you need to find out which clubs exist in your municipality. ## Numbers: 9 ##

Even though the context is mainly about clubs and associations, it does provide a clue to the answer. The context suggests that you should find out which clubs exist in your municipality (sentence 9). This could potentially include organizations that offer integration courses. Therefore, the answer to the question is to find out which clubs exist in your municipality.

However, it is important to note that the context does not explicitly mention integration courses or how to register for them. Therefore, the answer may not be entirely satisfactory.
