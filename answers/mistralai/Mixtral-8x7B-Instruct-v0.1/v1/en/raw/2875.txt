## Answer: The duration of vocational training is guaranteed for tolerated status. To obtain a tolerated stay permit, a training contract must be submitted to the regional council. The application is submitted via the Foreigners' Registration Office together with further documents. Qualified training in a state-recognized or comparably regulated training occupation with a standard training period of at least two years is required. The vocational training must be entered in the register of vocational training relationships. Identity must be clarified, but this may be waived if all reasonable and necessary steps have been taken within the applicable period and the identity is/was still not clarified. The regional council decides whether the training permit is granted despite the unclear identity. An introductory qualification (EQ) does not grant a training permit, but it still offers advantages such as preparation for vocational training and the possibility of an accompanying language course. ## Numbers: 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18
