## Answer: If a refugee under the age of 18 comes to Germany unaccompanied, they need an adult to legally represent them instead of their parents. This person is called a guardian. The guardian has various tasks such as maintaining regular personal contact with you, representing your interests vis-Ã -vis the Youth Welfare Office, the Immigration Office and other authorities, accompanying you through the asylum procedure, applying for necessary help for you, and supporting you in clarifying other matters, for example on the subject of health. ## Numbers: 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
