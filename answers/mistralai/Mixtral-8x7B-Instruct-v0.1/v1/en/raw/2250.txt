## Answer: To work in Germany, you generally need to apply for a work permit at your foreigners authority before starting work, which requires your future employer to fill in a form about the job conditions. If you are an asylum seeker, you can get a work permit after 3 months if you have minor children or after 6 months if you don't have minor children and have already been in Germany for 3 months. Your work permit is specific to the job for which it is granted. ## Numbers: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11
