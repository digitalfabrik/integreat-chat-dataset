## Answer: In Germany, you can only buy medicines in pharmacies. Every pharmacy can be recognized from the outside by the red A and is open from Monday to Saturday. Opening hours vary depending on the pharmacy. If you urgently need a medicine outside opening hours, you will find a sign at every pharmacy with the name and address of the pharmacy that is open for emergency service. There are prescription and over-the-counter medications. You can only obtain prescription medication if a doctor issues a prescription, while over-the-counter medication can be obtained from pharmacies without a prescription. ## Numbers: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19, 27, 30, 31
