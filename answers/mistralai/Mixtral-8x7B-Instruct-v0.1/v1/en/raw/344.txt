## Answer: TranslAid places volunteer (non-professional) interpreters with refugees and migrants in Munich who have appointments in the S-Bahn area of the city of Munich. The interpreters accompany people to consultations and appointments (e.g. doctor's appointments, appointments with authorities, asylum and legal proceedings, youth welfare and registry office, etc.) and translate documents that may not be translated by sworn translators. Requests must be made at least 48 hours in advance on working days. ## Numbers: 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 19 ##
