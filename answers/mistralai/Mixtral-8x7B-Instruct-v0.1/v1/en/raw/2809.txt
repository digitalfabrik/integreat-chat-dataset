## Answer: Self-help groups are self-organized groups of people who have the same problem or illness and want to do something together to get better. The participants exchange ideas and information, share examples of how other affected people deal with the illness or the problem in certain situations in everyday life, and provide support and help to each other. Self-help groups are not a substitute for medicine or therapy, but are a very good and important addition. What is said in the self-help groups is confidential and everything is voluntary, no one is forced. ## Numbers: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
