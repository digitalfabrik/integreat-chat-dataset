## Answer: There are various methods if you do not want to get pregnant or want to prevent infection with sexually transmitted diseases. For example, barrier methods such as the condom, or methods with hormones such as the pill. Multilingual information on the subject of contraception can be found at: www.zanzu.de, www.profamilia.de. A condom protects against sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV. You can find out about contraceptive methods from a gynecologist. Emergency contraception is available if you have sexual intercourse without contraception or if there is a mistake when using contraception. You can take the morning-after pill, which must be taken as soon as possible, preferably in the first twelve hours after sexual intercourse. You can buy the morning-after pill without a prescription from a pharmacy and obtain advice on this from a pharmacy or doctor. ## Numbers: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 ##
