## Answer: German Pension Insurance is a social security system in Germany that provides pensions and other benefits to people who can no longer work in old age. It is funded by contributions from employment subject to compulsory insurance, with half paid by the employer and the other half by the employee. To claim a pension, an application must be submitted at least 3 months before retirement. German Pension Insurance also offers rehabilitation measures to help people work again, without reducing their later pension benefit, and may even increase the pension benefit if the person remains fit for work for longer as a result. ## Numbers: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16
