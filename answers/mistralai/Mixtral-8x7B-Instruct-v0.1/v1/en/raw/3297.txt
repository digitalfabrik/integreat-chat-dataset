Although the provided context does not directly explain the difference between asylum and refugee status, it does mention the "asylum procedure" in sentence 3, which implies that asylum status is granted through a specific legal process. Additionally, the context refers to "refugee and integration advice" in the title and throughout the text, indicating that refugee status is a type of asylum status. Therefore, we can infer that asylum status is a broader category that includes refugee status, which is granted to people who have a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific protected characteristics.
