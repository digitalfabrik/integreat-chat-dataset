## Answer: To enroll your child in a school in Germany, you should go to the Rathaus (town hall) to find out which school your child can attend. You will need to provide your identification, a Meldebescheinigung (proof of residence), and any documents related to your child (such as their passport, birth certificate, report cards, and medical records). You should also bring your child with you to the school when you enroll them. The specific deadlines and procedures may vary depending on the region and type of school, so it is best to inquire several weeks or months in advance. If you are unsure which school your child should attend, you can ask your social counseling/integration manager, youth migration advice, or migration advice. You can also find information directly at schools in your area or at the Rathaus. ## Numbers: 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 24, 26, 28, 29 -1
