## Answer: If you want to terminate your employment in Germany, you must send a written notice to your employer, preferably by mail. If you are terminated and wish to take action, you have three weeks to file a claim with the help of a lawyer and/or at the Rechtsantragsstelle at the labor court. The employer's notice period is usually four weeks to the end of the month. The notice period for employees depends on the duration of the employment. For example, after 5 years, the notice period is 2 months. The probation period cannot exceed 6 months, with a notice period of 2 weeks. ## Numbers: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 ##
