## Answer: The Chancen-Aufenthaltsgesetz, or Opportunity Stay Law, allows individuals who have been living in Germany with a Duldung (tolerated stay permit) for many years to obtain permanent residency more quickly. To be eligible, individuals must not have a criminal record, must not have provided false information or concealed their identity, and must acknowledge the democratic basic order of Germany. The Chancenaufenthalt is granted for 18 months and is not extendable. After 18 months, if the individual can support themselves financially, has a valid identity document, and can demonstrate good knowledge of the German language, they will receive a residence permit for an additional 18 months, during which they can fulfill the requirements for permanent residency. ## Numbers: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16
