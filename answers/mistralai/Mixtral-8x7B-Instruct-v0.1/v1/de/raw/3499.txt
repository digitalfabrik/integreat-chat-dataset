## Answer: To be able to take an integration course, you need to have a "Berechtigungsschein" (permission slip) from the Bundesamt f체r Migration und Fl체chtlinge (BAMF). You can either get this slip voluntarily if you wish to take the course, or you may be required to take the course by the Amt f체r Ausl채nderwesen und Integration. ## Numbers: 13,15,17,21,22,33,35,36,37,39 ##
