TBE (early summer meningoencephalitis)\nTBE is transmitted via tick bites.\nPossible consequences of a disease are inflammations of the brain, the meninges and the spinal cord.\nEspecially Bavaria, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and southern parts of Hesse, Thuringia and Saxony are considered risk areas in Germany.\nEspecially in these areas, vaccination against TBE is recommended by the STIKO.\nAll children can attend from the age of 1. The vaccination against TBE must be carried out before the child's 60th birthday.\n2. Influenza (flu)\nInfluenza is contagious in a similar way to a normal cold (flu).\nTransmission in kindergartens and schools usually occurs from child to child or via objects.\nChildren with pre-existing conditions are particularly affected.\nComplications such as pneumonia can occur in them.\nThe recommendation for annual flu vaccination is therefore only aimed at children with a higher risk of complications.\nYou can find more information about the affected pre-existing conditionshere.\n3. HPV (human papilloma viruses)\nPapilloma viruses can cause cancer in the long term.\nVaccination can therefore reduce the risk of cancers of the cervix, anus, penis and throat.\nVaccination before the first sexual contact offers the best protection.\nBoth vaccinations are recommended between the ages of 9 and 14.\n4. Meningococcus\nMeningococci are bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis or blood poisoning (sepsis).\nChildren under the age of 5 and adolescents are particularly at risk.\nVaccination against meningococcal type C is recommended at the age of 12 months.\nThere is currently no general recommendation for vaccination against other types (B and ACWY).\nThe bacteria are transmitted via so-called droplet infection, i.e. for example via coughing, sneezing or kissing.\n5. Pneumococcus\nPneumococcus is the most common pathogen of severe bacterial infections.\nThey can cause meningitis, pneumonia or middle ear infections and are especially dangerous for babies and small children.\nThree vaccinations are recommended against pneumococci, which should be administered at the same time as the vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough.\n6. Rotaviruses\nRotaviruses are the most common cause of diarrhoea and vomiting in children.\nThe pathogen is very contagious, which is why almost all children contract it in the first five years - usually at the age of 2. Especially in infants, a large loss of fluids and salt can lead to dangerous dehydration, which may have to be treated in hospital.\nRotaviruses are vaccinated two or three times, depending on the vaccine.\nThe first vaccination should be given between 6 weeks and 2 months of age, the second at 3 months and the third, if necessary, at 4 months.\nVaccination against the Corona virus is currently recommended for children aged 5 to 11 years only with the vaccine \"Comirnaty\" from BioNTech\/Pfizer.\nVaccinations can be given at intervals of three to six weeks between the first and second vaccination.\nThe vaccination recommendation is primarily aimed at children who have an increased risk of a severe course due to a previous illness.\nIn addition, the recommendation also applies to children in whose environment there are persons with a high risk of a severe COVID-19 course, if they themselves cannot be vaccinated or the vaccination protection is not sufficient.\nThere is currently no recommendation for children without their own pre-existing conditions or pre-existing conditions of close contacts.\nNevertheless, it is possible to have your child vaccinated after consulting a doctor.\nFor more information on the affected pre-existing conditions, see:\nhttps:\/\/www.zusammengegencorona.de\/impfen\/kinder\/corona-schutzimpfung-ab-5-jahren\/\nFurther information
