more people are shopping online.\nThere are a few things to bear in mind.\nRemember that:\nOnline shopping does not only have positive effects.\nPackaging material and returns are a burden on the environment.\nAnd even local stores cannot keep up with the competition on the Internet.\nThat's why many stores are closing.\nThe local stores are empty.\nIt is therefore worth considering what you order on the Internet or buy directly on site.\nWhat should I look out for when shopping online?\nReputable online store or fake store?\nWant to order something online?\nThen you should find out about the online store beforehand.\nBecause not all platforms are reputable.\nSo-called fake stores offer cheap goods that you do not receive after payment or that you receive in poor condition.\nHow can I recognize a dubious online retailer?\nStrikingly low price\nThe goods in the online store are remarkably cheap?\nHowever, this is not always an indication of a fake store.\nBut you should take a closer look.\nConspicuous Internet address\nA well-known website suddenly shows inconsistencies?\nThe domain extension has been extended (e.g.\nB. instead of \".de\" it says: \".de.com\")?\nThe Internet address contains the keyword \"plants\", but it sells shoes?\nThen these are signs of a fake store.\nNo imprint:\nEvery online store in the EU must have an imprint.\nIf the legal notice is missing, it is a sign of a dubious online store.\nHowever, the fraudsters know this too.\nTherefore, make sure that the imprint includes the following: Address, representative, e-mail address, reference to the commercial register.\nIf these criteria are met, it is highly likely that you are dealing with a reputable store.\nMissing GTC (General Terms and Conditions) and termination conditions\nGTCs are pre-formulated contractual terms and conditions.\nSo these are rules that apply to every purchase from this online store.\nIf you cannot find any terms and conditions on the site, then you should be careful with this online store.\nA reputable online store will provide information about the terms of termination.\nYou have a right of withdrawal with every purchase.\nInsecure payment methods\nNormally the rule is: first the goods, then the payment.\nHowever, many stores also offer prepayment.\nPrepayment means: You transfer the money before the goods are dispatched.\nMany payment methods are offered?\nBut in the last step you can only select \"Prepayment\" as the payment method?\nThen be careful!\nFalse quality seals\nMany fake stores use quality seals to gain the trust of potential customers.\nDo you see a quality seal on an online store?\nThen click on it.\nIf the quality seal is not linked to the corresponding website, then it is probably a fake.\nMissing or only positive customer reviews\nCustomer reviews on the online store's website are not always meaningful.\nOften only positive reviews are published.\nThe bad ratings will be deleted.\nYou can also search for customer reviews on other platforms.\nNo encrypted connection\nMake sure that the online store has an encrypted connection.\nEspecially if you have to enter your data or bank details.\nInsufficient product descriptions\nDoes the product description match the goods or services offered?\nIf not, it could be a fake store.\nShortcomings in the offer\nYou should be informed about delivery times and shipping costs before making a purchase.\nBe careful if this is not the case.\nLack of contact options\nAvoid online stores that only offer an e-mail address or a chargeable telephone number as a contact option.\nYou can easily check whether an online store is reputable with the Fake Shop Finder from the consumer advice center: Fake Shop Finder.\nTips for safe online shopping\nBe careful when entering your data.\nOf course, the online store needs your name and address for delivery.\nBut sometimes other things are also asked.\nThink about whether you really want to specify them.\nChoose online stores wisely.\nPay attention to the criteria listed above.\nCompare the prices with offers in the store.\nNot everything is cheaper on the Internet.\nPay attention to the total price: Is the price shown really the final purchase price (including taxes, customs duties and shipping costs)?\nContact customer service if you are unsure about anything.\nRead the experiences and reviews of other customers.\nCheck again before you place the order: Which products are in your shopping cart?\nHow high are the delivery costs?\nAre additional taxes due if the product comes from outside the EU?\nPrint out your order or purchase contract, the product description and the terms and conditions and cancellation policy or save them on your computer.\nThis means that the online retailer cannot change anything afterwards.\nHere you will find further information on safe shopping on the Internet in German and English (including an explanatory video in German).","city":"lkaugsburg","language":"en","jaccard":0.7631578947,"source_language":"de"}

{"id":3363,"question":"What should I do if I fall ill during my internship?","answers":[35,36,37],"context":"Rights and obligations during an internship\nInternship contract\nNo internship contract is required.\nBut it's good to have an internship contract.\nThis is because the regulations for the internship are laid down there.\nWorking hours\nDepending on age, there are different regulations on working hours during internships:\nUnder 15 years of age: Work is generally prohibited.\nThis does not apply to internships for school pupils, for example.\nAdolescents aged 13 and over may also carry out light activities (e.g.\ne.g. tutoring, delivering newspapers).\nYoung people under the age of 15 are under special protection: they may work a maximum of 7 hours per day and a maximum of 35 hours per week.\nBetween the ages of 15 and 18: Young people of this age may work a maximum of 8 hours per day and a maximum of 40 hours per week.\nOver 18 years: The regular working time of 8 hours per day should apply.\nHowever, regular means that there may be exceptions.\nIf there is a lot to do, interns are allowed to work more than 8 hours.\nA maximum of 10 hours may be worked per day.\nBreaks\nPeople on internships may and must also take breaks.\nAge also plays a role in the break times:\nUnder 18 years of age: If you work between 4.5 and 6 hours, you must take a 30-minute break.\nFor more than 6 hours even 60 minutes.\nOver 18 years: If you work for more than 6 hours, you must take a 30-minute break.\nFor working hours of more than 9 hours, even 45 minutes.\nDuty of confidentiality\nInterns learn a lot about the company during their internship.\nMuch of the information is confidential.\nThis means that interns are not allowed to pass on this information.\nThis is called \"confidentiality\".\nFor example:\nOne person is doing an internship in a doctor's surgery.\nShe learns a lot about the patients there.\nFor example, the names and illnesses of the patients.\nShe must not disclose this information to anyone.\nIllness\nIn the event of illness, the intern must inform the internship company immediately.\nInterns often need a medical certificate from a doctor.\nIt is best to ask the internship company whether a certificate is required.\nVacation\nThere is no entitlement to vacation during a mandatory internship.\nIt is possible to take vacation during a voluntary internship.\nBut only if the internship lasts more than 4 weeks.\nThe vacation days depend on the age of the intern and the duration of the internship.\nBehavior in the workplace\nInterns mean time and work for the internship company.\nInterns should be aware of this.\nInterns should therefore behave accordingly.\nYou can find tips on this under \"Ten tips for interns\".\nEntitlement to an internship certificate\nInterns are entitled to an internship certificate.\nThis means that the company or business must issue an internship certificate.\nThe internship certificate is important for the intern.\nIt helps later when applying for an apprenticeship or job.\nIt describes which activities the intern has carried out.\nSometimes the assessment of your performance during the internship is also included in the certificate.","city":"lkaugsburg","language":"en","jaccard":1.0,"source_language":"de"}
