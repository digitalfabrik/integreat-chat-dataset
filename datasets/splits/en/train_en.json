HPV (human papillomavirus)\nPapillomaviruses can cause cancer in the long term.\nVaccination can therefore reduce the risk of cancer of the cervix, anus, penis and throat.\nVaccination before the first sexual contact offers the best protection.\nBoth vaccinations are recommended between the ages of 9 and 14.\n4. meningococci\nMeningococci are bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis or blood poisoning (sepsis).\nChildren under the age of 5 and adolescents in particular are among the risk groups.\nVaccination against meningococcal type C is recommended at the age of 12 months.\nThere is currently no general recommendation for vaccinations against other types (B and ACWY).\nThe bacteria are transmitted via the so-called\nDroplet infection.\nThis means, for example, coughing, sneezing or kissing.\n5. pneumococci\nPneumococcus is the most common pathogen causing serious bacterial infections.\nThey can cause meningitis, pneumonia or middle ear infections.\nThey are particularly dangerous for babies and small children.\nThree vaccinations against pneumococci are recommended.\nThese should be administered at the same time as the vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough.\n6. rotaviruses\nRotaviruses are the most common cause of diarrhea and vomiting in children.\nThe pathogen is very contagious.\nThis is why almost all children contract the disease in the first five years - usually at the age of 2.\nIn infants in particular, a large loss of fluids and salt can lead to dangerous dehydration.\nThis may have to be\nbe treated in hospital.\nVaccination against rotaviruses is given two or three times, depending on the vaccine.\nThe first vaccination should be given between 6 weeks and 2 months of age.\nThe second vaccination at 3 months.\nAnd the third, if necessary, at 4 months.\nVaccination against the coronavirus is currently only recommended for children aged 5 to 11 years with the \"Comirnaty\" vaccine from BioNTech\/Pfizer.\nVaccinations can be given three to six weeks apart between the first and second vaccination.\nThe vaccination recommendation is primarily aimed at children who have an increased risk of a severe course due to a previous illness.\nIn addition, the recommendation also applies to children who are surrounded by people with a high risk of severe COVID-19 if they cannot be vaccinated themselves or the vaccination protection is not sufficient.\nThere is currently no recommendation for children without pre-existing illnesses or pre-existing illnesses of close contacts.\nNevertheless, it is possible to have your child vaccinated after consulting a doctor.\nFurther information on the pre-existing conditions concerned can be found

Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and southern parts of Hesse, Thuringia and Saxony in particular are considered risk areas in Germany.\nVaccination against TBE is recommended by the STIKO in these areas in particular.\nAll children can be vaccinated against TBE from their 1st birthday.\n2. flu (influenza)\nInfluenza is as contagious as a normal cold (flu-like infection).\nTransmission in kindergartens and schools usually occurs from child to child.\nOr about objects.\nChildren with pre-existing conditions are particularly affected.\nThey can lead to complications such as pneumonia.\nThe recommendation for an annual flu vaccination is therefore only aimed at children with a higher risk of complications.\nYou can find further information on the pre-existing conditions concerned here.\n3. HPV (human papillomavirus)\nPapillomaviruses can cause cancer in the long term.\nVaccination can therefore reduce the risk of cancer of the cervix, anus, penis and throat.\nVaccination before the first sexual contact offers the best protection.\nBoth vaccinations are recommended between the ages of 9 and 14.\n4. meningococci\nMeningococci are bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis or blood poisoning (sepsis).\nChildren under the age of 5 and adolescents in particular are among the risk groups.\nVaccination against meningococcal type C is recommended at the age of 12 months.\nThere is currently no general recommendation for vaccinations against other types (B and ACWY).\nThe bacteria are transmitted via the so-called\nDroplet infection.\nThis means, for example, coughing, sneezing or kissing.\n5. pneumococci\nPneumococcus is the most common pathogen causing serious bacterial infections.\nThey can cause meningitis, pneumonia or middle ear infections.\nThey are particularly dangerous for babies and small children.\nThree vaccinations against pneumococci are recommended.\nThese should be administered at the same time as the vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough.\n6. rotaviruses\nRotaviruses are the most common cause of diarrhea and vomiting in children.\nThe pathogen is very contagious.\nThis is why almost all children contract the disease in the first five years - usually at the age of 2.\nIn infants in particular, a large loss of fluids and salt can lead to dangerous dehydration.\nThis may have to be\nbe treated in hospital.\nVaccination against rotaviruses is given two or three times, depending on the vaccine.\nThe first vaccination should be given between 6 weeks and 2 months of age.\nThe second vaccination at 3 months.\nAnd the third, if necessary, at 4 months.\nVaccination against the coronavirus is currently only recommended for children aged 5 to 11 years with the \"Comirnaty\" vaccine from BioNTech\/Pfizer.\nVaccinations can be given three to six weeks apart between the first and second vaccination.\nThe vaccination recommendation is primarily aimed at children who have an increased risk of a severe course due to a previous illness.\nIn addition, the recommendation also applies to children who are surrounded by people with a high risk of severe COVID-19 if they cannot be vaccinated themselves or the vaccination protection is not sufficient.\nThere is currently no recommendation for children without pre-existing illnesses or pre-existing illnesses of close

is because the regulations for the internship are laid down there.\nWorking hours\nDepending on age, there are different regulations on working hours during internships:\nUnder 15 years of age: Work is generally prohibited.\nThis does not apply to internships for school pupils, for example.\nAdolescents aged 13 and over may also carry out light activities (e.g.\ne.g. tutoring, delivering newspapers).\nYoung people under the age of 15 are under special protection: they may work a maximum of 7 hours per day and a maximum of 35 hours per week.\nBetween the ages of 15 and 18: Young people of this age may work a maximum of 8 hours per day and a maximum of 40 hours per week.\nOver 18 years: The regular working time of 8 hours per day should apply.\nHowever, regular means that there may be exceptions.\nIf there is a lot to do, interns are allowed to work more than 8 hours.\nA maximum of 10 hours may be worked per day.\nBreaks\nPeople on internships may and must also take breaks.\nAge also plays a role in the break times:\nUnder 18 years of age: If you work between 4.5 and 6 hours, you must take a 30-minute break.\nFor more than 6 hours even 60 minutes.\nOver 18 years: If you work for more than 6 hours, you must take a 30-minute break.\nFor working hours of more than 9 hours, even 45 minutes.\nDuty of confidentiality\nInterns learn a lot about the company during their internship.\nMuch of the information is confidential.\nThis means that interns are not allowed to pass on this information.\nThis is called \"confidentiality\".\nFor example:\nOne person is doing an internship in a doctor's surgery.\nShe learns a lot about the patients there.\nFor example, the names and illnesses of the patients.\nShe must not disclose this information to anyone.\nIllness\nIn the event of illness, the intern must inform the internship company immediately.\nInterns often need a medical certificate from a doctor.\nIt is best to ask the internship company whether a certificate is required.\nVacation\nThere is no entitlement to vacation during a mandatory internship.\nIt is possible to take vacation during a voluntary internship.\nBut only if the internship lasts more than 4 weeks.\nThe vacation days depend on the age of the intern and the duration of the internship.\nBehavior in the workplace\nInterns mean time and work for the internship company.\nInterns should be aware of this.\nInterns should therefore behave accordingly.\nYou can find tips on this under \"Ten tips for interns\".\nEntitlement to an internship certificate\nInterns are entitled to an internship certificate.\nThis means that the company or business must issue an internship certificate.\nThe internship certificate is important for the intern.\nIt helps later when applying for an apprenticeship

contributions.\nIf you are self-employed, you must also pay taxes.\nIncome tax\nIncome tax contributes to the financing of federal, state and local government expenditure.\nTaxpayers' money is used to build roads and schools, for example, or to finance social benefits.\nIf you are employed, you will receive the net amount of your salary from your employer, i.e. your taxes have already been deducted.\nIf you are self-employed, you are responsible for paying tax on your income.\nTax identification number\nAll employees receive a \"tax identification number\" at the start of their employment.\nThis tax ID is an 11-digit number and is used for income tax purposes.\nIt is valid for a lifetime.\nChildren born in Germany receive a letter with their personal tax ID within three months of birth, which is also required, for example, to apply for child benefit.\nIf you work in Germany, you will need the number again and again, for example for your employer.\nIf you do not know the number, you can ask for it in person at the registration office or in writing at the Federal Tax Office.\nTax return\nIn your annual tax return, you can claim various expenses from the tax office as tax-reducing.\nThis may result in either repayments in your favor or additional payments to the tax office.\nMany people are required to submit a tax return, so it is best to ask the tax office whether this applies to you.\nIf you need help with your tax return, it is best to contact your local income tax association.\nIf you have further questions, the tax office can also help you.\nSocial security contributions\nSocial security contributions are the social security contributions that employees have to pay from their gross monthly salary in addition to taxes - this is mandatory by law and is automatically calculated by the employer.\nPart of the social insurance is also paid by the employer.\nSocial security contributions finance the German social system.\nIf people cannot find

often is rotavirus vaccination given and at what age should the first vaccination be given?","answers":[41,42,43,44],"context":"Further STIKO vaccination recommendations\n1. tBE (tick-borne encephalitis)\nTBE is transmitted via tick bites.\nPossible consequences of the disease are inflammation of the brain, the meninges and the spinal cord.\nBavaria, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and southern parts of Hesse, Thuringia and Saxony in particular are considered risk areas in Germany.\nVaccination against TBE is recommended by the STIKO in these areas in particular.\nAll children can be vaccinated against TBE from their 1st birthday.\n2. flu (influenza)\nInfluenza is as contagious as a normal cold (flu-like infection).\nTransmission in kindergartens and schools usually occurs from child to child.\nOr about objects.\nChildren with pre-existing conditions are particularly affected.\nThey can lead to complications such as pneumonia.\nThe recommendation for an annual flu vaccination is therefore only aimed at children with a higher risk of complications.\nYou can find further information on the pre-existing conditions concerned here.\n3. HPV (human papillomavirus)\nPapillomaviruses can cause cancer in the long term.\nVaccination can therefore reduce the risk of cancer of the cervix, anus, penis and throat.\nVaccination before the first sexual contact offers the best protection.\nBoth vaccinations are recommended between the ages of 9 and 14.\n4. meningococci\nMeningococci are bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis or blood poisoning (sepsis).\nChildren under the age of 5 and adolescents in particular are among the risk groups.\nVaccination against meningococcal type C is recommended at the age of 12 months.\nThere is currently no general recommendation for vaccinations against other types (B and ACWY).\nThe bacteria are transmitted via the so-called\nDroplet infection.\nThis means, for example, coughing, sneezing or kissing.\n5. pneumococci\nPneumococcus is the most common pathogen causing serious bacterial infections.\nThey can cause meningitis, pneumonia or middle ear infections.\nThey are particularly dangerous for babies and small children.\nThree vaccinations against pneumococci are recommended.\nThese should be administered at the same time as the vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough.\n6. rotaviruses\nRotaviruses are the most common cause of diarrhea and vomiting in children.\nThe pathogen is very contagious.\nThis is why almost all children contract the disease in the first five years - usually at the age of 2.\nIn infants in particular, a large loss of fluids and salt can lead to dangerous dehydration.\nThis may have to be\nbe treated in hospital.\nVaccination against rotaviruses is given two or three times, depending on the vaccine.\nThe first vaccination should be given between 6 weeks and 2 months of age.\nThe second vaccination at 3 months.\nAnd the third, if necessary, at 4 months.\nVaccination against the coronavirus is currently only recommended for children aged 5 to 11 years with the \"Comirnaty\" vaccine from BioNTech\/Pfizer.\nVaccinations can be given three to six weeks apart between the first and second vaccination.\nThe vaccination recommendation is primarily aimed at children who have an increased risk of a severe course due to a previous illness.\nIn addition, the recommendation also applies to children who are surrounded by people with a high risk of severe COVID-19 if they cannot be vaccinated themselves or the vaccination protection is not sufficient.\nThere is currently no recommendation for children without pre-existing illnesses or pre-existing illnesses of close contacts.\nNevertheless, it is possible to have your child vaccinated after consulting a doctor.\nFurther information on the pre-existing conditions concerned can be found
